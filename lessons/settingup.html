<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>A web browser</h3>

<p>
    Judging by the fact that you are here, you already have a web browser! In
    the broadest definition of <dfn>web browser</dfn>, it is an application that
    lets a user to access a website. There is a lot of options available for
    this, however most people use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or
    Opera. Recently, Internet Explorer has been discontinued and replaced by
    Microsoft Edge, which is now the default on Windows.
</p>

<p>
    Why do we need it? Well, we will be writing code as text files. Think of
    this as writing an essay. Now you want your titles to be a bit larger and
    colored red. Now you want to center an image. So, you need a program to
    interpret what you have written, figure out where your titles are, and
    display the page with the rules we have just defined. We could find an
    application to do all of these steps for us, so that we have an idea on what
    is displayed on screen. Luckily, we do not need to look far. All common
    browsers support this <dfn>rendering</dfn> process, which in this context
    implies getting a text file and then interpreting it with the
    <dfn>markup</dfn> (styling) rules such as the color of a title. Basically,
    we will use the web browser (that you have this webpage open on) in order to
    see our creations!
</p>

<h3>An IDE</h3>

<p>
    As the abbreviation suggests, an <dfn>IDE</dfn> (Integrated Development
    Environment) is a development environment. We have previously mentioned that
    we will be writing our code as a text file. In theory, nothing stops you
    from writing your code in a Notepad file. Before you go ahead and do that
    though, I should emphasize that it's a horrible idea.
</p>

<p>
    An IDE supports much more than typing. The advantages depend on which IDE
    you are using, but pretty much all IDEs support some autocompletion.
    Programming usually require a lot of characters that we do not use often in
    our day-to-day texting. For instance HTML, a markup language we will discuss
    very soon, relies heavily on the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;)
    symbols. When you have some styling in your code, you will be required to
    surround all rules with curly brackets ({ }) and end every line with a
    semicolon (;). Imagine the time you would save just by not having to type
    these symbols over an over, on top of the autocompletion of words!
</p>

<p>
    Because IDEs are designed with programming on mind, they of course offer
    much more than autocompletion too. The one that is the most important to me
    are the <b>syntax highlighting</b>. That is just a fancy term for giving a
    different color to each word depending on its purpose. As a side effect,
    this function warns you about typos and incorrect usage of things before you
    even complete your code. A pre-emptive warning for such errors is a
    timesaver when the time comes to go back to your code and fixing issues.
</p>

<p>
    Not only that, most IDEs are <b>customizable</b>. You could add more and
    more automation to your work environment depending on your needs. For
    example, I have an <b>extension</b>, or an extra feature on my IDE that
    automatically formats my code based on standards and conventions every time
    I save a file. Isn't that amazing not to worry about small things and focus
    solely on the code?

        For this guide, I will be using <b>VS Code</b> (short for Visual Studio
        Code). It is free, supported by major operating systems (Windows, iOS
        and Linux) and easy to navigate. It is also fairly customizable.
        <br /><br />
        <button
            id="download"
            class="button-lg"
            onclick="window.open('https://code.visualstudio.com/download', '_blank')"
        >
            Download VS Code
        </button>
    </p>
</div>

<h3>That's it!</h3>

<p>You are now ready to start!</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you are using <b>VS Code</b>, you can continue with this lesson. I
        will show how to set it up and how to navigate.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are <b>not</b> using VS Code, feel free to skip the rest of this
        lesson. I will be covering the topics that are applicable to all IDEs in
        the next lesson instead. Sadly, the examples and screenshots I will
        provide in this guide will be from VS Code, so there may be minor
        differences. This should not create any issues functionally though!
    </li>

<h3>TODO</h3>

<p>
    Sadly I have not finished this section yet. Don't worry, I am actively
    writing these posts and it should not take too long before it's complete. If
    you can't wait to start, the installation is pretty straightforward! You can
    try it on your own and ask me if you have any have questions!
