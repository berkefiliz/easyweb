<h2>Web design</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    As pretty much everyting else, <dfn>web design</dfn> is a very broad term
    that consists of various subtopics. In a really general sense, it refers to
    the design of a website that is displayed on the internet. The size, color,
    animations and functionality of a button on a website is therefore a product
    of web design.
</p>

<p>
    I find the approach "practical knowledge before theoritical" and so I will
    be discussing the terminology in much more detail as we cover the related
    coding section. That said, I would like to give an overview of the inner
    works of web design.
</p>

<h3>Frontend vs backend</h3>

<p>
    When we are talking about anything that is visible to the user, we talk
    about <dfn>frontend design</dfn>. When you look at the layout of the
    website, or font sizes, or how a button's color changes when you hover over
    it with your mouse, or how you navigate to another page when you click on
    "Go back" are all parts of the frontend. This is a very large area as well,
    and this guide will cover some of the two main aspects of it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>User Interface (UI): The look of a website</li>
    <li>User Experience (UX): The feel of a website</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These two terms feed each other and a good website should excel at both. If
    you find the color palette an eyesore, maybe that was not a good UI
    decision. If you found navigating between pages difficult, the UX needs
    improvements.
</p>

<p>
    Especially when the website deals with data, we are talking about
    <b>backend design</b>. This may be as simple as storing the username and
    password of users, retrieving the data when necessary to see whether the
    credentials were correct to log in. I am saying <i>simple</i> not because it
    is easy, but because the idea behind it is simple.
</p>

<p>
    The topics backend design covers are not directly visible to the user. For
    example, a user should not be able to view the data stored on the servers.
    So the data has to be secure. When I am retrieving data for this lesson or
    when the user is trying to log in, that should be quick. I have to
    oversimplify this topic for now, as pretty much everyting backend deals with
    is very abstract. Without some context, it is difficult to give examples.
</p>

<div class="icontext">
    <div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i></div>
    <p class="text">
        As a quick summary, <b>frontend</b> deals with everyting that is visible
        to the user and therefore handled in the web browser. Meanwhile
        <b>backend</b> deals with everything that is not necessarily visible to
        the user and therefore handled on a server and not on the web browser.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Other things</h3>

<p>
    For a public web project, the modern standards are high and continuously
    evolving. It is no longer enough just look nice for the website to be
    considered good. There are many aspects of <b>frontend design</b> that
    require throughout thinking and prior planning.
</p>

<p>
    Let's think of a widely used website. Think of your favourite store. Go and
    visit their website on your desktop, and then visit the same page on your
    phone. Do you see any differences? For most of the cases, the answer should
    be yes. This is because the designers need to make sure the website looks
    well on any common screen size. Desktops have a landscape (wide) screen
    while phones have a portrait (longer and narrow) screen. Hence, it may be
    more difficult to fit two elements side by side on a phone screen and the
    website has to adapt. This is called <b>responsive</b> design.
</p>

<div class="icontext">
    <div class="icon"><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i></div>
    <p class="text">
        The context does matter for these standards. If you open
        <b>EasyWeb</b> on your phone, you will realize there is no difference
        between phone and desktop sites. This is because the guide is meant to
        be followed along on a desktop so that you can write and experiment with
        code on the side. It was a conscious decision to not spend any time
        resource on making sure it has a different layout for mobile, as the
        development of the content is right now more important than mobile
        support.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Another thing to consider is the <b>accessibility</b> of a website. I can
    give a very basic example of putting white text on yellow background. I am
    thinking of something
    <span style="background-color: yellow; color: white">like this</span>. You
    will see it is very difficult to read. There is an acceptable range of
    contrast, which makes using colors that are too similar and too different
    from each other.
</p>

<p>
    Accessibility covers much more. Anyone with an impairment should be able to
    navigate the site. Do you not use any gaps between text for it to "breathe"
    a bit? Do you use a font that is very uncommon? Do you have flashing
    animations? Are your fonts, layouts and colors not consistent with each
    other? Then these are things you should reconsider. Honestly, this topic
    deserves its own lesson and I will be covering that in the future.
</p>

<h3>Final notes</h3>

<p>
    There are so many aspects of the design like the ones listed above. Some
    such as security and functionality sound trivial. Some such as search engine
    optimization and accesibility are too large to cover in a single lesson. I
    will make sure to address these when necessary throughout the blog and I
    will also have a section to wrap up these topics towards the end. Otherwise
    the list of topics will feel like an information dump :/
</p>

<p>
    Now let's focus on setting up your work environment so that you can start
    coding. You can find more information about that in the next lesson!
